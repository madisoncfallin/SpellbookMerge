# Spellbook Merge

This is a mod for Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous. It adds additional spellbook merging options.

## Warnings

This mod creates new blueprints and thus creates a save dependency. Once your save depends on this mod, it is not safe to uninstall it.

To be careful, install this mod just before reaching Mythic Rank 3. Test that you get the option to merge spellbooks, if not file a bug report.

I have tested this mod only with Aeon-Inquisitor, the other merges are untested (for now).

## Mythic Paths

### Aeon

Aeon gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks

* WarPriest
* Inquisitor

### Azata
Azata gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks
* Magus
* Bard
* Skald
* Sword Saint

### Demon
Demon gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks
* BloodRager

### Trickster
Trickster gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks
* Alchemist
* Eldritch Scoundrel
* Magus
* Sword Saint

## Base Spellbooks

All the above mentioned spellbooks have had their spell progressions patched so that they are able to cast highest level spells from their merged mythic paths.

All of them should be able to cast highest level spells from their Mythic Paths upon reaching caster level 25.


## FAQ

### Why can't we merge Angel and Paladin (or insert any other funky combination)?

Technically we can, but balancing them is a nightmare. It is easier to merge full casters with full casters (eg: Angel-Oracle, Lich-Sorcerer) and hybrid casters with hybrid casters (eg: Aeon-Inquisitor, Azata-Magus).
Paladin only gains up to 4th level spells, if we allow Angel to merge with it, there is no easy way to balance Paladin spell progression so that it is able to cast 9th/10th level spells.
If you have any suggestions for balancing, let me know and I will think about it.
